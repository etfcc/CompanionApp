# CompanionApp
**Disclaimer: This project is only a demo. It cuts corners everywhere possible and probably shall not be used anywhere in production. Although I found it usefull in my particular setup. You may fork it the way you want it. Good hunting!

## Problem:
You want to do some external actions on a certain events generated by FCC Desktop applciaton.<br> 
**Example:**
You want your external light to go ON when you join to a video call and OFF when you are done. 
- OR - 
You want certain script to run after you finished your 9am meeting? 

## Solution:
FCC desktop app fires an AF_UNIX datagram  upon certain event. Currently it only supports CAMERA ON|OFF events. Request more <HERE>.
Event has the following format :
<pre>
[version 1 byte ] [ type 1 byte ] [ payload size  2 bytes ] [ payload ... ] 
</pre>

## Implementation:
This particular demo turns ON/OFF external light https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/key-light when FCC application turns its camera ON/OFF.  
To find the address of the light I used zeroconf project from here https://github.com/yvz/zeroconf

## Deployment:
This is a console applciation that can be run by launchd on Mac to sit on the background. 
Put the followng file to 
<pre>~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.freeconferencecall.companionapp.plist</pre>
